//! Bounded archive decompression for ingestion/serve metadata extraction.
//!
//! Every format that needs package coordinates (name/version/description)
//! decompresses the uploaded or served archive *inside the request handler* to
//! read a single small metadata file (`Chart.yaml`, `.nuspec`, `pubspec.yaml`,
//! `METADATA`, `.podspec.json`, `metadata.config`, …). Those extractors never
//! touch the scanner's bounded extractors (`unpack_*_limited`, #2514) nor the
//! Debian-index cap (#2482), so historically they decoded a gzip/zip/bz2 stream
//! with **no cap on total decompressed bytes**, walked tar entries with **no
//! entry-count cap**, and read the target entry with **no per-entry cap** — a
//! decompression-bomb / unbounded-memory surface at upload and serve time.
//!
//! This module consolidates the proven bounding primitives into three shared
//! helpers so every ingestion metadata extractor gets the same three caps with
//! one implementation:
//!
//! 1. a **total decompressed-byte budget** on the decoded stream (default
//!    128 MiB, env [`MAX_INGEST_DECOMPRESSED_BYTES_ENV`]) — the core mechanism;
//!    it defeats both the *pre-target-inflation* bomb (huge entries walked
//!    before the metadata file) and the *entry-count* bomb (the walk hits the
//!    byte budget and stops),
//! 2. a **10 000 entry-count cap** ([`MAX_INGEST_ARCHIVE_ENTRIES`]) —
//!    defence-in-depth against inode/entry-count bombs with a clearer error,
//! 3. an **8 MiB per-metadata-entry cap** ([`MAX_INGEST_METADATA_ENTRY_BYTES`])
//!    — a metadata file larger than this is itself a bomb.
//!
//! Reference implementations reused here (do not re-derive):
//! - the scanner's `positive_env_or` env-override idiom and `copy_entry_bounded`
//!   running-budget check (#2514),
//! - the Debian index `.take()` byte budget (#2482),
//! - **`api/handlers/swift.rs::extract_manifest_from_zip`** — already correctly
//!   bounded (`size()` pre-check + `.take(N + 1)` per entry, random-access zip
//!   so unmatched entries are never inflated); this module generalises exactly
//!   that pattern to the other formats.
//!
//! All caps sit far above real packages — metadata files are KB-scale, so a
//! legitimate large chart/wheel/nupkg/pod/gem reads only a few KB before the
//! match and never approaches a cap. A cap breach is surfaced as
//! [`AppError::Validation`] (HTTP 400) so ingestion **rejects** the bomb rather
//! than silently truncating or hanging.

//
// The three per-archive caps above bound a *single* extraction's memory/CPU,
// but place no bound on the NUMBER of extractions running at once. Every
// ingestion/serve metadata extractor decodes on the request path, so N parallel
// uploads decode N archives concurrently — N × up-to-`max_ingest_decompressed_bytes()`
// decode buffers plus N × decompressor CPU at the same time. This mirrors the
// scanner's own concurrent-extraction gap (`scanner_service.rs` #2540), which
// caps in-flight scan-workspace extractions with a process-wide semaphore.
//
// This module adds the ingestion analogue: a process-wide semaphore whose
// permits bound the number of concurrent ingestion decodes. Unlike the
// scanner's FIFO *blocking* acquire (detached background scans have no client
// latency SLA and must complete), ingestion decode happens on the request path,
// so the guard is acquired FAST-FAIL: on saturation it sheds the request with a
// 503 ([`AppError::ServiceUnavailable`]) instead of queueing more decode work.
// It is a *separate* semaphore from the scanner's, so ingestion and scan
// extractions do not double-count against one shared budget.

/// Default cap on how many ingestion/serve archive decompressions may run at
/// once, across ALL format extractors. Bounds worst-case concurrent decode
/// memory/CPU to roughly `cap × per-archive-cap`. A small default keeps the
/// out-of-the-box worst case modest while still allowing parallel uploads.

// Per-tenant fairness sub-limit (#2598)
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The global cap above (#2561) bounds worst-case aggregate decode memory/CPU,
// but it is fair only in aggregate: one noisy tenant firing many concurrent
// uploads can consume every global permit and starve other tenants, which then
// see 503s caused entirely by a neighbour. This layer adds per-tenant fairness
// at the SAME acquire seam so all ~20 extractor call sites inherit it.
//
// Fairness key: the **repository** (`TenantKey::Repo(repo_id)`). A repository is
// AK's natural tenant boundary — it belongs to exactly one organisation and
// every ingestion/serve decode targets exactly one repo. Crucially,
// `repo_visibility_middleware` already resolves the repo id once for every
// format ingestion/serve route, so a single ambient scope set there
// ([`run_with_tenant_scope`]) attributes every downstream extractor decode to
// its tenant with no per-handler plumbing. Contexts with no request-scoped repo
// (background curation sync / migration import, or the middleware branches that
// never resolve a repo) run under [`TenantKey::Unattributed`], a shared bucket
// still bounded by the global ceiling.
//
// Mechanism: each tenant gets its own small semaphore (the sub-limit). An
// acquire takes the tenant sub-permit FIRST (fast-fail 503 when the tenant is
// already at its sub-limit, so it sheds without ever touching a global permit),
// THEN the global permit as the hard backstop (fast-fail 503 when the global
// ceiling is saturated). Shedding both with a 503 mirrors #2561's fast-fail
// semantics rather than queueing more decode work. The sub-limit is clamped to
// at most the global ceiling (a sub-limit above the ceiling can never bind).
//
// The tenant semaphores live in a `Weak`-valued registry: while a tenant holds
// any permit its semaphore is kept alive by the guard's owned permit; once idle
// the `Arc` drops, the `Weak` dies, and the entry self-cleans on the next
// lookup, so the registry cannot grow unboundedly across a churn of tenants.
